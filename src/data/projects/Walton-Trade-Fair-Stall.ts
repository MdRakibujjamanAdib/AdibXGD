    summary: "Concept stall design for Walton at Dhaka International Trade Fair, created in 3ds Max to showcase brand presence, product zones, and 5G promotion.",
    description: "<p style='text-align: justify;'>This project presents a conceptual exhibition stall designed for Walton at the Dhaka International Trade Fair. Modeled and visualized in Autodesk 3ds Max, the objective was to create a modern, brand-focused space that highlights product innovation while maintaining a clean and inviting layout.</p>\
<p style='text-align: justify; margin-top: 30px;'><b>Brand Identity & Form:</b> The stall design follows Walton’s signature blue and white color scheme, integrating bold curves and layered horizontal elements to create a dynamic yet corporate structure. The illuminated Walton logo is positioned prominently to ensure maximum visibility across the exhibition hall.</p>\

<p style='text-align: justify; margin-top: 30px;'><b>Zoning & Visitor Flow:</b> The layout is divided into clear functional zones, including product display walls, interactive seating areas, and a central promotional focal point featuring a bold 5G installation. The open-front design encourages smooth visitor movement while keeping key brand messages visible from multiple angles.</p>\
<p style='text-align: justify; margin-top: 30px;'><b>Product Showcase Strategy:</b> Dedicated display panels highlight Walton’s smartphone lineup and camera capabilities, supported by large-format visuals to enhance engagement. The use of clean lighting and minimal clutter ensures attention remains on the products.</p>\
<p style='text-align: justify; margin-top: 20px;'>This concept demonstrates my ability to design exhibition stalls that combine branding, spatial planning, and 3D visualization. From architectural structure to promotional detailing, the project showcases how a trade fair booth can function as both a marketing space and a strong brand experience.</p>",
